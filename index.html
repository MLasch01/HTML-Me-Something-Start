         <p>It’s a tale as old as time.  But this one only goes back 22 years.  As a young boy, my father instilled in me a love for classic cars, especially classic Ford Mustangs.  He had a 1966 Mustang as a teenager and regrettably sold it to purchase a more family friendly vehicle with the anticipated arrival of his first child (not me, not my fault)… what a bummer.
            <br>
            <br>As I grew older and the anticipation of buying my first car was getting closer and closer, I knew I wanted a classic Mustang.  I started working at 14 years old to save all I could.  At 16-years-old, about a month from my 17th birthday, I was searching online car markets and local Classified ads every day when I finally found it!  A 1966 Ford Mustang, just like my dad’s, for sale about an hour away.  It had a beautiful body, ran well, and was priced perfectly for how much money I had saved.

         <p id>Life was perfect.  I was 16, school was about to start, and I had just purchased my dream car and I was driving it everywhere…and driving it like an idiot.  16-year-olds should not be allowed to drive fast classic cars.  They are not smart enough.  I learned this through a very expensive lesson.  After only driving the Mustang for a few weeks, I blew a head gasket, destroying the entire engine.  This was a mistake that would cost me more money than I had paid for the car and about six months of sitting at a repair shop and I couldn’t drive it.
            <br>
            <br>This hurdle passed and I drove my cherished Mustang with much more respect, most of the time.  After all, 17-year-olds are not much smarter than when they were 16.

         <p>Time passed and my Mustang came along with me to college, getting married, joining the Army and traveling the country from the east coast to the west with a few stops in between.  Even after my daughter was born, my Mustang is still with me.  I wasn’t going to make the same mistake as my dad.
             <br>
            <br>Thankfully as I have gotten older, I purchased another vehicle as my daily driver and my Mustang is pampered in the garage.  But this isn’t enough to satisfy an unpredictable classic car.  Modern cars have the wonderful convenience of A/C which is the one amenity missing which makes driving most classic cars unbearable in a St. Louis summer.  While maintaining tune-ups and oil changes throughout the summer, it doesn’t get much drive time.  But without fail, when those unusual weekends with temperatures below 90 degrees when I want to go for a drive, the Mustang won’t start.  This has apparently become our tradition, as it has happened for the past three years causing frustration and igniting panic as fall is just around the corner when the weather is perfect for enjoying a Saturday morning cruise somewhere.
